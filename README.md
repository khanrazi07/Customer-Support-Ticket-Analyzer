# Customer-Support-Ticket-Analyzer
Developed a customer support ticket classification system using Python and scikit-learn that analyzes customer issue descriptions and predicts predefined ticket categories. The trained model was deployed as a REST API using FastAPI, allowing ticket classification functionality to be accessed programmatically through HTTP requests.
